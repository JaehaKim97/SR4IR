    """
    Logs API usage(module and name) within an organization.
    In a large ecosystem, it's often useful to track the PyTorch and
    TorchVision APIs usage. This API provides the similar functionality to the
    logging module in the Python stdlib. It can be used for debugging purpose
    to log which methods are used and by default it is inactive, unless the user
    manually subscribes a logger via the `SetAPIUsageLogger method <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/eb3b9fe719b21fae13c7a7cf3253f970290a573e/c10/util/Logging.cpp#L114>`_.
    Please note it is triggered only once for the same API call within a process.
    It does not collect any data from open-source users since it is no-op by default.
    For more information, please refer to
